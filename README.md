# NYU_javascript_project

I have always been awed by Mike Bostock's work on D3 visualizations, especially his power on using visualization to explain complicated subjects like algorithms ( https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/).

This project is a mimic of his visualization but also made numerous changes to the animation and style, for the purpose of improving observability.

While Mike's post only includes Quick Sort and Merge Sort, I added Insertion Sort to my project, just to learn how to transform an algorithm to visualization from scratch.

The site was built in several weekends.  In order to save time, I borrowed the color scheme and some design elements from http://www.csszengarden.com/221/ (but I rewrote the CSS myself), which I should also give credit to.

Here is the deployed site: https://amy-learns-js.netlify.app/
